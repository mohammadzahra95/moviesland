          <span class="film-title">Gravity :</span>:Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra
          Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her
          commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), helming
          his last flight before retirement. Then, during a routine space walk
          by the pair, disaster strikes: The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan
          and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of
          rescue. As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home
          may be to venture further into space. Gravity shares similarities with
          traditional tales of determination to return home and survival. The
          Odyssey and Castaway come to mind. But in space, this narrative takes
          on a new perspective. The theme of perseverance is written all over
          this movie, with Stone questioning her ability to keep fighting — to
          look death in the face and either go on or give up. This is a story
          about going against all odds when the entire universe is against you.

          vaults, armored cars) and are, in turn, hunted by Lt. Vincent Hanna
          and his team of cops in the Robbery/Homicide police division. A
          botched job puts Hanna onto their trail while they regroup and try to
          put together one last big 'retirement' score. Neil and Vincent are
          similar in many ways, including their troubled personal lives. At a
          crucial moment in his life, Neil disobeys the dictum taught to him
          long ago by his criminal mentor--'Never have anything in your life
          that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the
          heat coming around the corner'--as he falls in love. Thus the stage is
          set for the suspenseful ending

          <span class="film-title">Back to the Future: </span> Marty McFly, a
          typical American teenager of the Eighties, is accidentally sent back
          to 1955 in a plutonium-powered DeLorean "time machine" invented by a
          slightly mad scientist. During his often hysterical, always amazing
          trip back in time, Marty must make certain his teenage parents-to-be
          meet and fall in love - so he can get back to the future. That night,
          Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, Emmett "Doc" Brown, in the
          Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a
          modified DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan
          terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955
          (the day he first conceived his time travel invention), the terrorists
          arrive unexpectedly and gun him down. Marty flees in the DeLorean,
          inadvertently activating time travel when he reaches 88 miles per hour
          (142 kilometers per hour).

          <span class="film-title">Interstellar:</span> In 2067, a global famine
          caused humanity to abandon scientific pursuits such as space
          exploration. Ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is forced to work as a
          farmer. One day, Cooper experiences a gravitational "anomaly" in his
          daughter Murph's bedroom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS
          coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed by Professor
          Brand. Brand explains to Cooper that it is engaged in a secret mission
          to discover an exoplanet capable of supporting life and that he is
          working on a gravity-equation. He enlists Cooper's help to pilot an
          exploratory spacecraft with three other scientists Romilly, Doyle, and
          Brand s daughter Amelia. The crew travels through a wormhole on board
          the Endurance to pass through to another galaxy. Their mission is to
          investigate three planets, orbiting a supermassive black hole called
          Gargantua, each of which was previously explored by a NASA
          scientist-explorer.

          Gray, is researching the evolution of the eye with research partner,
          Kenny, and first-year lab assistant, Karen. At a Halloween party Gray
          encounters Sofi, a young woman masked with only hazel-speckled,
          ash-blue eyes visible. She later leads him into the washroom to have
          sex before abruptly leaving. Mysterious synchronicities, like the
          recurring number 11, guide Gray to a billboard on which he recognizes
          Sofi's eyes. Eventually he sees her on a train. They begin a
          relationship although his rationalism clashes with her fey
          spirituality. One day they spontaneously agree to marry but must wait
          a day for a license. Disappointed, they walk out of the registry
          office. Ian gets a call from Karen. She has found a blind worm—Eisenia
          fetida—with the DNA necessary to develop an eye. Ian takes Sofi to the
          lab with him.

          <span class="film-title">The Wolf of Wall Street: </span> In the early
          1990s, Jordan Belfort teamed with his partner Donny Azoff and started
          brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. Their company quickly grows from a
          staff of 20 to a staff of more than 250 and their status in the
          trading community and Wall Street grows exponentially. So much that
          companies file their initial public offerings through them. As their
          status grows, so do the amount of substances they abuse, and so do
          their lies. They draw attention like no other, throwing lavish parties
          for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades. That
          ultimately leads to Belfort featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine,
          being called "The Wolf Of Wall Street." With the FBI onto Belfort's
          trading schemes, he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his
          fortune grow. Belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their
          cash in a European bank. But with the FBI watching him like a hawk,
          how long will Belfort and Azoff be able to maintain their elaborate
          wealth and luxurious lifestyles?

          Carcaterra - Shakes to his friends - Michael Sullivan, Tommy Marcano,
          and John Reilly were inseparable. They grew up in Hell's Kitchen, a
          far from perfect neighborhood, one filled as Shakes says with scams
          and shake downs, but one where the rules were known and easily
          understood by its residents. The one adult who they admired was Father
          Bobby Carelli, who understood them as kids more than most adults and
          more than he himself would like to admit. In 1967, their lives would
          change forever when a typical teenage prank went wrong which led to
          the four of them being sentenced to various terms at Wilkinson Home
          for Boys, a reformatory.
